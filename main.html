                                    This washing machine is used by residents of the Graduate C building and is located in the
                                    laundry room on the first floor. The key interactive components of this interface is the control
                                    panel, the door, and the pullout drawer for detergent, bleach, etc. The control panel has 3 options
                                    for soil level, 2 options for cycle type, and 3 options for temperature. It also features a timer,
                                    indicator lights, and a start button. The pullout drawer features 4 compartments meant for softener,
                                    prewash, liquid bleach, and liquid detergent.
